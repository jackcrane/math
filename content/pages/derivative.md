# The Derivative

> The derivative is a fundamental concept in calculus that allows us to analyze the rate of change of a function and find the slope of a curve at any point.

## Introduction

The derivative is a mathematical tool that allows us to analyze the rate of change of a function and find the slope of a curve at any point. It is a fundamental concept in calculus and is used in many areas of science, engineering, and economics. Understanding derivatives is crucial for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.

## Things to Know

Before we dive into the rules for finding derivatives, there are a few important things to keep in mind:

- The derivative is denoted using the symbol $f'(x)$, which means "the derivative of f(x) with respect to x".
- The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is the slope of the tangent line to the curve of f(x) at that point.
- The rules for finding derivatives depend on the form of the function being differentiated and the technique used to differentiate it.
- Derivatives can be used to analyze the behavior of functions, find maximum and minimum values, and solve optimization problems.

## Example Problem

Let's start with a simple practice problem to illustrate how to find derivatives.

Find the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$:

Therefore, the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 6x - 4$.

To find the derivative, we use the power rule, which states that the derivative of a function of the form $f(x) = x^n$ is $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$. We apply this rule to each term in the expression $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$:

- The derivative of the first term $3x^2$ is $6x$, since $2 \cdot 3x^{2-1} = 6x$.
- The derivative of the second term $-4x$ is $-4$, since $1 \cdot -4x^{1-1} = -4$.
- The derivative of the third term $1$ is $0$, since the derivative of a constant is always $0$.
- Putting these results together, we get:

$f'(x) = 6x - 4 + 0 = 6x - 4$

Therefore, the derivative of $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$ is $f'(x) = 6x - 4$.

It's worth noting that the derivative of a function represents the instantaneous rate of change of the function at any given point. In this case, the derivative $f'(x) = 6x - 4$ tells us that the rate of change of the function $f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 1$ increases at a rate of $6$ units per unit of $x$. We can also use the derivative to find the slope of the tangent line to the curve of $f(x)$ at any point.

## Common Rules

There are several common rules for finding derivatives, including:

- Power Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} x^n = nx^{n-1}$
- Constant Multiple Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} cf(x) = c\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$
- Sum and Difference Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) \pm \frac{d}{dx} g(x)$
- Product Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} [f(x)g(x)] = f(x)\frac{d}{dx} g(x) + g(x)\frac{d}{dx} f(x)$
- Quotient Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{g(x)\frac{d}{dx} f(x) - f(x)\frac{d}{dx} g(x)}{g(x)^2}$
- Chain Rule: $\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$
- Implicit Differentiation: If a function is defined implicitly, we can still find its derivative by differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x.

Remember that these rules are just a starting point and not all derivatives can be found using just these techniques. It's important to practice and get familiar with these techniques to develop your intuition for finding derivatives.
