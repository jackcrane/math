# Limits

> Limits are a fundamental concept in calculus that allow us to understand the behavior of functions as they approach certain values or infinity.

## Introduction

Limits are a way to analyze the behavior of functions as they approach certain values. They are used to define derivatives and integrals, and are a crucial tool for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.

## Things to Know

Before we dive into the rules for solving limits, there are a few important things to keep in mind:

- Limits are typically denoted using the symbol $\lim_{x \to a}$, which means "the limit of f(x) as x approaches a".
- The limit of a function f(x) at a point a is the value that f(x) approaches as x gets arbitrarily close to a.
- The rules for solving limits depend on the form of the function being evaluated and the technique used to evaluate it.
- Limits can be evaluated using direct substitution, factoring, rationalization, conjugation, or other techniques.

## Example Problem

Let's start with a simple practice problem to illustrate how limits work.

Find the limit of $f(x) = 2x + 1$ as $x$ approaches $3$ (denoted as $\lim_{x \to 3} (2x + 1)$

To find the limit, we simply substitute $3$ for $x$ in the expression $2x + 1$:

$\lim_{x \to 3} (2x + 1) = 2(3) + 1 = 7$

Therefore, the limit of $f(x) = 2x + 1$ as $x$ approaches $3$ is $7$.

## Common Rules

There are several common rules for solving limits, including:

- Direct Substitution: If the function is defined at the point being evaluated, then simply plug in the value and evaluate the limit.
- Factoring: If the function is in a fraction form, factor out the common factor and simplify the expression.
- Rationalization: If the function has a square root or cube root in the numerator or denominator, multiply by the conjugate to simplify the expression.
- L'Hopital's Rule: If the function has the form $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, then use L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate the limit.
- Squeeze Theorem: If the function is between two other functions that have the same limit, then the function being evaluated has the same limit.

Remember that these rules are just a starting point and not all limits can be solved using just these techniques. It's important to practice and get familiar with these techniques to develop your intuition for solving limits.
